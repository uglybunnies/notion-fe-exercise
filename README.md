This excercise was completed using the [SveltKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework. Here are the simple instructions to setup the project on your local machine

## Local Setup
Fetch the repo and enter into the project dictory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uglybunnies/notion-fe-exercise.git
cd notion-fe-exercise
```


Once you are in the project directory, install the project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've  installed dependencies, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
